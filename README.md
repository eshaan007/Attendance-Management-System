# Attendance Management System 🏫 

Github Repo link : https://github.com/eshaan007/Attendance-Management-System

### It is divided into 2 parts 
 - A view portal for insertion
 - View System for the faculty and Student
 
#### It uses HTML, CSS as Front-End, PHP for Backend, MySQL for Database Handling and XAMPP Server for hosting.

An Attendance View Portal is developed. The login page is common for both the faculty as well as students. At the end, the attendance is submitted to the database. \
When a successful login occurs, faculty can see the date wise attendance of all the subjects. The student will be able to see his/her date wise or subject wise attendance.

## This is what every file in my Repository does : 

- ***config.php*** :            Makes connection with localhost and other different files. 
- ***admin.php*** :             Registers himself. From welcome page, he goes to different pages from the panel.
